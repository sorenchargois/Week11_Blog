This piece, funded by AdCouncil, expresses that no matter how a person looks on the outside, we are all the same on the inside. It was the second most viewed community activism campaign of all time. The demonstration showed different sets of skeletons kissing, hugging and dancing before revealing themselves to passersby as biracial couples and differently abled and friends.

Chris accomplished this porject by setting up a giant ersatz X-ray installation at the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, Calif. and recorded as people interacted with it. The YouTube video exploded and became viral in a small number of days.

### J013 Playing the Building, by David Byrne

David Byrne turned the Battery Maritime Building in lower Manhattan into a musical instrument by attaching machines to various parts of the building. "Playing the Building" allowed visitors or passersby to play the building with the touch of a piano key. Using pipes and wires interconnected various places in the building space to create a giant musical instrument. 

I thought this was a very interesting piece in how it changes with every user/player. I think thats a unique aspect of this installment.
